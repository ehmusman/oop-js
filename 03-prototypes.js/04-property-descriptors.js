console.log(Object.keys(person)) // we'll only see the name

// becuse in javascript our proprtties have attributes attach to them. whats its meaning?
// some time these attributes prevent the properties to be enumerated.

// the answer is
// configurable: true  // means we can delete this member if we want to
// enumerable: false    //  thats why we were unable to see the toString method when iterate over the person object.

// value: Æ’ toString()

// writable: true  // means we can overwrite this method. we can change its implementstion, we can set its value.
